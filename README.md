#TASK1

✨ Factorial Calculator in Python
This Python script calculates the factorial of a user-provided number using an iterative approach with a for loop.

📄 Description
The script defines a factorial() function that multiplies all integers from 1 to the input number. The result is then displayed to the user.

🧠 How It Works
The user is prompted to enter a number.

The script calculates the factorial using a loop.

It prints the result in a formatted message.

Example
plaintext

#TASK2

🧮 Scientific Calculator Script
This Python script performs basic mathematical operations on a number entered by the user using the math module.

📄 Description
When executed, the script prompts the user to enter a number. It then calculates and prints the following:

✅ Square Root

✅ Natural Logarithm

✅ Sine Value (in radians)

📌 Example
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 25
Square root:  5.0
Logarithm:  3.2188758248682006
Sine:  -0.13235175009777303
🛠 How to Run
Make sure Python 3 is installed.

Save the script in a file named TASK2.py.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the script with the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python TASK2.py
🧠 Concepts Used
math.sqrt() — for square root

math.log() — for natural logarithm

math.sin() — for sine value in radians

User input and basic output formatting

⚠️ Note
Ensure the number entered is positive; logarithm and square root of negative numbers will raise an error.
